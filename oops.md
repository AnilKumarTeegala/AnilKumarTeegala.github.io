Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Meaning, it supports different programming approach.

One of the popular approach to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

An object has two characteristics:
- attributes
- behavior

Let's take an example:

If `student` is an object then,

- name, age, color are `attributes`
- singing, Writing, Playing are `behavior`

## Class
Class is a collection of attributes and methods

syntax:
```python
class student:
  attributes
  methods
```
#### Attributes
Attributes are variables of a class that are shared between all of its instances

#### Methods
Methods are functions defined inside the body of a class. They are used to define the behaviors of an object

## Objects
An object is an instance of a class. When class is defined, only the description for the object is defined. Therefore, no memory or storage is allocated.

The example for object of student class can be:
```python
obj = student()
 ```
Here, `obj` is object of class `student`

## Constructor

### __init__
We use the **__init__()** method to initialize (e.g., specify) an objectâ€™s initial attributes by giving them their default value (or state). This method must have at least one argument as well as the self variable, which refers to the object itself (e.g.: student)

**`Note:`** We will never have to call the `__init__()` method; it gets called automatically when we create a new `class` instance.
```python
class student:
    # Initializer / Instance Attributes
    def __init__(self, name, rollnumber):
        self.name = name
        self.rollnumber = rollnumber
```
## Types of Attributes
1. **Instance variables**:
They are owned by the specific instances of a class. This means for two different instances the instance attributes are usually different

2. **Class variable or Static Variable**:
Class attributes are attributes which are owned by the class itself. They will be shared by all the instances of the class. Therefore they have the same value for every instance. We define class attributes outside of all the methods, usually they are placed at the top, right below the class header.
example:
```python
class student:
  college = 'APSSDC'
  def __init__(self, name, rollnumber):
    self.name = name
    self.rollnumber = rollnumber
std1 = student('Student1', '123456')
std2 = student('Student2', '654321')
print("Instance variables are:")
print(std1.name)
print(std2.name)
print("Class variables are:")
print(std1.college)
print(std2.college)
```
After Execution the output is
```output
Instance variables are:
Student1
Student2
Class variables are:
APSSDC
APSSDC
```
## Types of Methods
1. Instance methods
Instance methods are defined inside a class and are used to get the contents of an instance. They can also be used to perform operations with the attributes of our objects. Like the `__init__` method, the first argument is always `self`

Example:
```python
class student:
    college = 'APSSDC'
    
    def __init__(self, subject1, subject2, subject3):
        self.subject1 = subject1
        self.subject2 = subject2
        self.subject3 = subject3

    def average(self):
        return (self.subject1 + self.subject2 + self.subject3) / 3
        
std1 = student(58,92,45)
std2 = student(96,91,85)

print('Average marks of std1 is:', std1.average())
print('Average marks of std2 is:', std2.average())
```
The Instance methods are classified in two types
i. Accesor method
ii. Mutator method
2. Class methods
3. Static methods
