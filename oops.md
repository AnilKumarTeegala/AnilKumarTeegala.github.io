Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Meaning, it supports different programming approach.

One of the popular approach to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

An object has two characteristics:
- attributes
- behavior

Let's take an example:

If `student` is an object then,

- name, age, color are `attributes`
- singing, Writing, Playing are `behavior`

## Class
Class is a collection of attributes and methods

#### Attributes
Attributes are variables of a class that are shared between all of its instances

#### Methods
Methods are functions defined inside the body of a class. They are used to define the behaviors of an object

syntax:
```python
class student:
  attributes
  methods
```
## Objects
An object is an instance of a class. When class is defined, only the description for the object is defined. Therefore, no memory or storage is allocated.

The example for object of student class can be:
```python
obj = student()
 ```
Here, `obj` is object of class `student`
